# -Quantum-noise-simulation-on-quantum-gates
Understanding coherent and incoherent noises and simulating these noise errors in some some simple quantum gates.
Quantum noise is a big nuisance in practical quantum computing,it is responsible for giving innacurate rseults of the qubit state when measured.
There are many types of quantum noises such as state preparation noise, measurement noise, Pauli noise, coherent noise, incoherent noise etc.We intend to understand the behaviour of the last two noises.
